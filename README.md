# Getting Started with Create React App# COVID-19 Tracker
Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. What can we, as developers, do to make the situation better? We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and in cards we showed statistics as well as Charts. 

## The applications uses 
[React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/), [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), React Hooks, API data fetching]

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
